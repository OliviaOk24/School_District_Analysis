Thomas High School Performance

In this analysis, the 9th grades students at THS were taken out. Although taking out the Thomas High School 9th grade students reduced the math, reading and overall passing percentages, THS's percentages were still on the higher end in comparison to the other schools in the district. THS is doing overall better than a lot of schools in the district, with or without the 9th grade students addition. It also shows that the 9th grade have relatively higher percentage as they reduced the overall percentages. 

Replacing Scores 

- Math and Reading scores by grade: replacing the 9th grade scores lowered the math and reading scores and reading scores by grade. 
- Scores by school spending: replacing the scores did not affect the school spending 
- Scores by school size: replacing the scores with NaN did not affect the school size summary 
- Scores by school type: replacign the scores with NaN did not affect the school type summary table.

Summary 

There were a number of changes seen when the 9th grade scores of THS were replaced. Firstly, the reading and math score percentage dropped. Secondly, the overall percentage of the THS students dropped. Thirdly, THS scores in relation to the other schools are still relative highly high even after the drop from the removal of the 9th grade scores. Lastly, there was no change to the diffrent school summary outputs such as grouping schools by size, type, etc.
